# ============================================
# MedRemind - Project Requirements
# ============================================
# This project is built entirely in JavaScript (Node.js + React).
# Dependencies are managed via npm (see package.json).
#
# To install all dependencies, run:
#   npm install
#
# To start the app (both frontend + backend), run:
#   npm run dev
#
# ============================================
# Python Dependencies (if needed in future)
# ============================================
# Currently none - this is a pure JavaScript project.
# If you add Python-based services later, list them below.
