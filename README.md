 Project Description

MedRemind – “Never Miss a Dose, Stay in Control.”

MedRemind is a notification-driven smart medicine reminder and overdose prevention website designed to support elderly people in taking their medicines safely and on time.

The system is activated when the user clicks the medicine-time notification, which opens the website and dynamically checks whether the current time falls within the valid dosage window. It then enables the user to confirm medicine intake either manually or through AI-based pill verification.

The application continuously tracks the number of doses taken per day. If the intake exceeds the prescribed limit, a Malayalam warning is displayed and an automatic call is placed to the caregiver for immediate assistance.

The entire system is designed with a simple, login-free interface, large buttons, voice support, and offline functionality to ensure accessibility for elderly users and reliability in low-connectivity environments.
